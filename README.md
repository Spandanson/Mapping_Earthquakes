# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Mapping Earthquakes with JS and API's
## 1. BACKGROUND
* Basil and Sadhana like how we created our earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay.
* so, they would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.
* They would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. 
* They would also like to see the data on a third map.

## 2. RESULTS & OUTCOMES:
### The results are shown in a form of maps as shown below:
#### a. Earthquake map
